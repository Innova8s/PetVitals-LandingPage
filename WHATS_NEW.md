## 📋 What You Need to Do

### **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Updated Setup Process**

The setup is similar but with **2 critical additions**:

#### **NEW Step 1b: Get Spreadsheet ID**
After creating your Google Sheet, you need to **copy the Spreadsheet ID** from the URL:

```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LHJWCf3Hu0dAieq4vvYsnGk5_ni4k-sloicubPtyKSE/edit
                                        ↑ This is your Spreadsheet ID ↑
```

#### **NEW Step 2b: Update Configuration**
In `google-apps-script.js`, update these lines (around line 46-48):

```javascript
const SPREADSHEET_ID = 'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE'; // ← Paste your ID here
const SHEET_NAME = 'Sheet1'; // ← Change if different
const NOTIFICATION_EMAIL = 'enquiry@innova8s.com'; // ← Your email
```

#### **Updated Column Structure**
Your Google Sheet now needs **7 columns** instead of 6:

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Timestamp | **Source** | Name | Email | Interest | Pet Type | Message |

**Note:** The "Source" column is new!
